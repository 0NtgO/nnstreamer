# Note that the current version of github.sec.samsung.net does not translate
# @org/team-name (e.g., @RS7-STAR/audri_maintainers), even though
# https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/ depicts @org/team-name
# as well as @username format.
# So, We must write all IDs of @RS7-STAR/audri_maintainers manually.

# Note that when we migrate this to github.com, we need to rewrite the whole
# entries.
